## Common Issues and Solutions

### Unicode/Cyrillic Character Support (solved)
The application uses a custom slugify function to properly handle Cyrillic and other non-ASCII characters in recipe titles.

### Image Upload Issues (solved)
If images aren't displaying, check:
- Media directory permissions: `chmod 755 media/`
- Nginx configuration for media files
- Django settings for MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT

### 500 Server Errors (solved)
Common causes:
- Database connection issues
- Permission problems with media uploads
- Incorrect path settings

## Security Features

The site implements several security best practices:
- HTTPS with modern TLS configuration
- Secure HTTP headers
- CSRF protection
- XSS protection
- Proper permission model
- Password hashing with PBKDF2
